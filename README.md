THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:The efficiency of solar photovoltaic panels significantly decreases due to the accumulation of dust on their surfaces, leading to energy loss and reduced system performance. Traditional dust detection methods such as thermal imaging and IoT-based sensors are costly, require frequent maintenance, and offer limited accuracy. Therefore, there is a need for a low-cost, image-based, and automated solution. This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network model to accurately detect and classify solar panel surface conditions as clean or dusty from captured images, thereby improving maintenance scheduling and ensuring maximum energy output from solar panels.

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
Dust accumulation on solar panels reduces their ability to absorb sunlight, resulting in lower power generation efficiency. Manual inspection and cleaning are time-consuming and expensive, especially in large solar farms.This project aims to develop an automated Convolutional Neural Network model that detects the presence of dust on solar panels using image data. The system provides a smart, low-cost, and sustainable solution to monitor panel cleanliness and improve overall solar energy efficiency.

GOALS:
To build a CNN model that classifies solar panel images as clean or dusty.
To reduce manual maintenance costs by automating the dust detection process.
To enhance solar panel performance and support sustainable energy management.
To implement an efficient, real-time system that ensures maximum energy output with minimal human intervention.
